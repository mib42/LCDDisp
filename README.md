# LCDDisp
This is a small library for Arduino. It allows to connect a typical LCD with HD44780 controller via a PCF8574 I2C Portexpander.
There is a small single sided pcb available, wich can be placed behind the display, so it will become a compact unit, that studends can work with.
The board is designed to hold a standard 16x4 display (e.g. DisplayTech 164A). The wiring between the port expander and the LCD differs to the many boards already at the web. But all these boards are smd and therefore a bit difficult for students to built as their first self made and self soldered board. But to be honest: i just made it without searching the web first. 
To built a Arduino library for this piece of hardware was a nice job, i haven't done bevor.
